His pace really is scary. Look at both his goals. The acceleration is insane. When I saw the first goal live, I thought he wouldn't get the ball the moment it was played, but a second later I saw big man bearing down on Areola and gets a penalty. I feel even as a fan I'm not used to seeing this from City, considering the past few seasons.
People were saying how he scored against Bundesliga teams that didn't sit deep. Bro. The dude had like 6-7 meters from outside of the penalty box, chasing a ball running away from him, and he still got it. I think he will do amazing.
Overall, I think this game perfectly demonstrated what Haaland brings to City. A pacey, clinical striker, unafraid to run and cause chaos in the opponent's backline. His current developed style perfectly suits what City needs in attack. This game, however, also demonstrated that City hasn't fully implemented that style into their system yet. Evident by a lot of missed/ignored runs.
Obviously not every single run needs a through ball, but I feel that if even some of these options were explored, he would've had a hat-trick.",How did kev's goal against psg did not come here!

In 1962, Italy passed a law banning names with superlatives (such as super-, ultra-, stra-) for consumer products. Ferrero had to choose a new brand name: ""Nutella"" registered in October 1963, came from merging the English word ""nut"", from the typically Italian ingredient hazelnut in the gianduja, with the Italian positive-sounding suffix ""ella"". The winning combination came with the colors: the black ""N"" and the other letters in red. The first jar came out on April 20, 1964, starting the Nutella era.”","Imposter Chris - loserfruit 🍓

Earth can talk to Mars anytime of the year due to relay satellites placed at the lagrange points situated between earth and the sun but at its furthest point between both planets, it can take over 50min to send a message 1 way..
So in 20 years when people are on mars and earth people say “what’s up?”, they’ll have to wait nearly 2 hours for a “nothing, wbu?” The shortest time we can send a message in still takes 20min one way so, 45mins for a response. Pretty crazy hey.

Ima Villa fan and as u all know we adored our Skipper but he moved on and so did we. 
I want Jack to succeed and maybe even play a huge role in the rest of this season to help City win everything but I want him to be the best in the world while he's at City. He has it all in his game to be that guy. 
I work with an Arsenal fan who was jumping for joy when the news broke about Haaland being injured but I told him to calm down that City are just as good if not better with a false 9 system in play. This game will have showed him how potent City are in this system. Man they tore Liverpool apart and that challenge from Grealish to stop Salah from passing someone in was really nice to see bcos this is something Jack did a lot of while at Villa but never got credit for. 
City have it all to do now but they have also to hope that this very good and well drilled Arsenal side will slip up and atm it looks very unlikely. The thing with football is things can turn on a 6pence in a heartbeat.. U can be flying high one second and then next minutes ur 3-0 down and struggling. AFC have to keep the pressure on City now. The pressure is about to begin building now as each game passes by and we'll see how good Arteta really is if he can keep his players grounded and finish this season off in fine style. U get what u deserve in football no matter what anybody thinks. Where u finish in a season is usually where u deserve to finish.
